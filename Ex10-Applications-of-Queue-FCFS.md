## DATE: 10/03/2025
## AIM:
To write a C function to calculate the turnaround time of each process given their burst time and waiting time in First Come first Serve scheduling algorithm.
## Algorithm
1. Start with process, burst time, and waiting time arrays. 
2. Loop through each process from i = 0 to n-1. 
3. Compute tat[i] = burst_time[i] + wait_time[i]. 
4. End the algorithm. 

## Program:
```

```
```c

/*#include <stdio.h>*/
int turnaroundtime( int proc[], int n,int burst_time[], int wait_time[], int tat[]) 
{
    for(int i=0; i<n; i++)
    {
        tat[i] = burst_time[i] + wait_time[i];
    }
    return 0;
}

```

## Result:
Thus, the C function to calculate the turnaround time of each process given their burst time and waiting time in First Come first Serve scheduling algorithm is implemented successfully.
